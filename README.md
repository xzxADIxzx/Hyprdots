# General information
These are configuration files that I use on my home machine. \
Your are free to use any of them as much as you like.

# System configuration
I use vanilla Arch Linux, not any sort of derived distro, and as the name suggest, Hyprland as the compositor.
While it's likely to work on different configurations, I am not responsible for the outcome.
